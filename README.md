Whelp, here we go again. This project has some similarites to the last one, especially the idea that there's a command line that takes in commands from the user and causes the program to take some action. There are going to be 8 commands available to the user, with one being a trivial quit case. The code the text book gives us provies us with some basic functionality, but we're going to need to do quite a bit of work to build up from it. At least, that's how it looks to me at this time. Based on how the last project went, I think that we should just meet up as a large group, plug a laptop into one of the big TV/monitors, and all work on it together.
